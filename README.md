# ftio

ftio - fastText I/O - is a set of tools for working with fastText, an open-source library from the Facebook AI Research lab, in Python.

ftio is designed to be lightweight and usable in production for hundreds of languages along with Python libraries like [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) or [salestock/fastText.py](https://github.com/salestock/fastText.py) that wrap or otherwise implement fastText.
