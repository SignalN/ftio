# ftio

ftio - fastText I/O - is a set of tools for working with fastText, an open-source library from the Facebook AI Research lab, in Python.

ftio is made to use along with third-party Python libraries like [Gensim](https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim) or [salestock/fastText.py](https://github.com/salestock/fastText.py) that implement or wrap fastText to make it possible to work with fastText models.

ftio is designed to be lightweight, modular, usable in production and inherently language-agnostic - it should support applications that use text in hundreds of languages.

ftio is available [on PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ftio).  To install:

    pip install ftio
